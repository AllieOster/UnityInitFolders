‧͙⁺˚*･༓☾　Initialization scripts to start your projects a little bit faster　☽༓･*˚⁺‧͙


1 - Pull this somewhere super easy to find on your computer.

2 - Create your Unity project.

3 - Once opened, drag and drop the right folder into your Assets folder, in the "Project" area down your screen.
    --> If you're opening a new 2D project, drag & drop the folder named "InitFolders2D"

The 2D folder comes with these folders : 
  - Animations
  - Audio
  - Materials
  - Prefabs
  - Scripts
  - Sprites
  - Textures
  - TileMaps
  - UI

The 3D Folder comes with these folders : 
  - Animations
  - Audio
  - Materials
  - Models
  - Prefabs
  - Scripts
  - Shaders
  - Textures
  - UI

The scripts are easy to edit, 
so if you want to add or remove folders so you can keep only 
those you're sure to use every fraking time you're coding, 
it should be the easiest thing on earth.
